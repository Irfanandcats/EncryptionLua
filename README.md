# EncryptionLua
Simply encrypt one text into a big chunk of encryption. Coming along with a key in return!

# How does the system work?
EncryptionLua is a project based on a programming language called Lua.
It works by having an encryption list that hides all the encrypted keys.

## Note
EncryptionList.js doesn't contain the decrypted keys, only encrypted.

# Available Platforms
EncryptionLua uses io.open, which needs to get the location after download.

# How to use?

1. Download EncryptionLua, available on the website.
2. Require the lua file from the location where EncryptionLua is downloaded at.

```lua
local encryptionLua = require("Location\"EncryptionLua\"EncryptionLua.lua")
```

# Updates
EncryptionLua has a couple of updates, it may be updated when issues with it are reported.
