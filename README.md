# EncryptionLua
Simply encrypt one text into a big chunk of encryption. Coming along with a key in return!

# How does the system work?
EncryptionLua is a project based on a programming language called Lua.
It works by having an encryption list that hides all the encrypted keys.

### Note
EncryptionList.js doesn't contain the decrypted keys, only encrypted!
Deleting it will stop EncryptionLua.lua from working!
